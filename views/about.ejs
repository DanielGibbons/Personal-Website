				I graduated from the University of Leeds in the summer of 2019 with a Masters degree in
				Electronic Engineering. During my degree I had a 1 year placement at <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a> where I
				worked primarily as an Embedded Software Engineer and got the bug <icon class="fas fa-bug"></icon> for developing
				software (pun intended). Since graduating I've been working at <a href="https://www.x-labsystems.co.uk">X-Lab</a>
				doing both <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dev?lang=en">#dev</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/devops?lang=en">#devops</a>.
				In this role I've been working with a range of language and technologies including C#, Javascript, Terraform, Azure
				and the Elastic stack.
